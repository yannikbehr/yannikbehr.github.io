**"The theory of probabilities is only common sense reduced to a calculus." â€”Pierre Simon Laplace**

Probability is the natural language to quantify our decisions' risks and benefits. In my work I mostly focus on probabilistic analysis of earth structure and processes and the related natural hazards. To do so, I combine statistical methods including AI and Machine Learning with physics-based models to interpret datasets. The results are probabilistic models that I provide to decision makers through interactive graphs and dashboards.
